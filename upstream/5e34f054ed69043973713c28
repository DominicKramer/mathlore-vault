. "An equation that can be written in the form 
   \begin{equation} H(x,y,c)=0 \end{equation} is said to define
   a \term{ one-parameter family of curves } if, for each value 
   of $c$ in in some nonempty set of real numbers, the set of 
   points $(x,y)$ that satisfy forms a curve in the 
   $xy$-plane."
