ProtoDefines:
. "A function $f$ is said to be \term{ of exponential order } 
   $s_0$ if there are constants $M$ and $t_0$ such that 
   \begin{equation} |f(t)|\le Me^{s_0t},\quad t\ge t_0. 
   \end{equation} In situations where the specific value of 
   $s_0$ is irrelevant we say simply that $f$ is \term{ of 
   exponential order }."
