. "Let $R$ and $S$ be rings. A \term{homomorphism} of rings
   $\varphi:R\to S$ is a map such that for all $a,b\in R$, we 
   have \begin{itemize} \item $\varphi(ab) 
   =\varphi(a)\varphi(b)$, \item $\varphi(a+b) = \varphi(a) + 
   \varphi(b)$, and \item $\varphi(1) = 1$. \end{itemize} An 
   \term{ isomorphism} $\varphi:R\to S$ of rings is a ring 
   homomorphism that is bijective."
