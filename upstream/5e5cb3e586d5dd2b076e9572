. "We call a nonzero rational number $n$ a \term{ congruent
number} if $\pm n$ is the area of a right triangle with
rational side lengths. Equivalently, $n$ is a \term{ congruent
number} if the system of two equations
$$
  a^2+b^2 = c^2
$$
$$
  \frac{1}{2}ab = n
$$
has a solution with $a,b,c\in\mathbf{Q}$."
