. "Let $S$ be a subset of $A$. Then \begin{alist} \item $u_0$ 
   is a \term{ limit point } of $S$ if every deleted neighborhood
   of $u_0$ contains a point of $S$. \item $u_0$ is a \term{ 
   boundary point } of $S$ if every neighborhood of $u_0$ 
   contains at least one point in $S$ and one not in $S$. The 
   set of boundary points of $S$ is the \term{ boundary } of $S$,
   denoted by $ ial S$. The \term{ closure } of $S$, denoted by 
   $\overline{S}$, is defined by $\overline{S}=S\cup ial S$. 
   \item $u_0$ is an \term{ isolated point } of $S$ if $u_0\in S$
   and there is a neighborhood of $u_0$ that contains no other 
   point of $S$. \item $u_0$ is \term{ exterior } to $S$ if $u_0$
   is in the interior of $S^c$. The collection of such points 
   is the \term{ exterior } of $S$. \end{alist}"
