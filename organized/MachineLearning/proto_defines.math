. "\term{Supervised learning} defines problems where you know the
   ground truth label for your data in advance."
Metadata:
. note:
  . "For example, this could include a problem where you need to
     identify if an image is of a cat and you already have a
     collection of images with the correct labels of whether or
     not each image is a cat."


ProtoDefines:
. "With \term{unsupervised learning}, you do not know the labels for
   your data in advance, and the goal is to build a model that can
   find natural groupings of your data (called clustering), compress
   the information content (dimensionality reduction) or find association
   rules."



ProtoDefines:
. "\term{Classification models} assign your input data a label (or labels)
   from a discrete, predefined set of categories."
Metadata:
. note:
  . "Examples of classification problems include determining the type of
     pet breed in an image, tagging a document, or predicting whether or
     not a transaction is fraudulent."



ProtoDefines:
. "\term{Regression models} assign continuous, numerical values to your
   inputs."
Metadata:
. note:
  . "Examples of regression models include predicting the duration of a bike
     trip, a companyâ€™s future revenue, or the price of a product."
