. "Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be random variables associated 
   with an experiment. Suppose that the sample space (i.e., the
   set of possible outcomes) of $X_i$ is the set $R_i$. Then 
   the joint random variable ${\bar X} = (X_1, X_2, \ldots, 
   X_n)$ is defined to be the random variable whose outcomes 
   consist of ordered $n$-tuples of outcomes, with the $i$th 
   coordinate lying in the set $R_i$. The sample space $\Omega$
   of ${\bar X}$ is the Cartesian product of the $R_i$'s: 
   $$\Omega = R_1 \times R_2 \times \cdots \times R_n\ $$ The 
   joint distribution function of ${\bar X}$ is the function 
   which gives the probability of each of the outcomes of 
   ${\bar X}$."
