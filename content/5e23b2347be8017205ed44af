. "A metric space is a nonempty set $A$ together with a 
   real-valued function $\rho$ defined on $A\times A$ such that
   if $u$, $v$, and $w$ are arbitrary members of $A$, then (a) 
   $\rho(u,v)\ge 0$, with equality if and only if $u=v$; (b) 
   $\rho(u,v)=\rho(v,u)$; (c) 
   $\rho(u,v)\le\rho(u,w)+\rho(w,v)$. We say that $\rho$ is a 
   metric on $A$."
