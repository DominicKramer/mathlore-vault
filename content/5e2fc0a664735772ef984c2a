ProtoDefines:
. "For an absorbing Markov chain ${ \/}$, the matrix ${ \/} = 
   ({ \/} - { \/})^{-1}$ is called the {fundamental matrix\/} 
   for ${ \/}$. The entry $n_{ij}$ of ${ \/}$ gives the 
   expected number of times that the process is in the 
   transient state $s_j$ if it is started in the transient 
   state $s_i$."
