. "Suppose we have an experiment whose outcome depends on 
   chance. We represent the outcome of the experiment by a 
   capital Roman letter, such as $X$, called a {random 
   variable\/}. The {sample space\/} of the experiment is the 
   set of all possible outcomes. If the sample space is either 
   finite or countably infinite, the random variable is said to
   be {discrete\/}."
