. "{\bf (Chebyshev Inequality)} Let $X$ be a continuous random
   variable with density function $f(x)$. Suppose $X$ has a 
   finite expected value $\mu = E(X)$ and finite variance 
   $\sigma^2 = V(X)$. Then for any positive number $\epsilon > 
   0$ we have $$ P(|X - \mu| \geq \epsilon) \leq \frac 
   {\sigma^2}{\epsilon^2}\ . $$"
