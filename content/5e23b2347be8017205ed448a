. "If $\{a_n\}_k^\infty$ is an infinite sequence of real 
   numbers, the symbol $$ \sum_{n=k}^\infty a_n $$ is an 
   infinite series, and $a_n$ is the $n$th term of the series. 
   We say that $\sum_{n=k}^\infty a_n$ converges to the ^\infty
   a_n= -\infty. $$ A divergent infinite series that does not 
   diverge to $\pm\infty$ is said to oscillate, or be 
   oscillatory."
