. "A sequence of random variables $X_1$, $X_2$, $\dots$, $X_n$
   that are mutually independent and that have the same 
   distribution is called a sequence of independent trials or 
   an {independent trials process.\/} Independent trials 
   processes arise naturally in the following way. We have a 
   single experiment with sample space $R = 
   \{r_1,r_2,$\dots$,r_s\}$ and a distribution function $$m_X =
   \pmatrix{ r_1 & r_2 & \cdots & r_s \cr p_1 & p_2 & \cdots & 
   p_s\cr}\ . $$ We repeat this experiment $n$ times. To 
   describe this total experiment, we choose as sample space 
   the space $$ \Omega = R \times R \times\cdots\times R, $$ 
   consisting of all possible sequences $\omega = 
   (\omega_1,\omega_2,$\dots$,\omega_n)$ where the value of 
   each $\omega_j$ is chosen from $R$. We assign a distribution
   function to be the {product distribution\/} $$ m(\omega) = 
   m(\omega_1)\cdot\ \ldots\ \cdot m(\omega_n)\ , $$ with 
   $m(\omega_j) = p_k$ when $\omega_j = r_k$. Then we let $X_j$
   denote the $j$th coordinate of the outcome $(r_1, r_2, 
   \ldots, r_n)$. The random variables $X_1$,~$\dots$, $X_n$ 
   form an independent trials process."
