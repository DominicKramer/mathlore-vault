. "The binomial coefficients are given by the formula $ {n 
   \choose j }= \frac{(n)_j}{j!}\ . $ .2in {\bf Proof.\ } Each 
   subset of size $j$ of a set of size $n$ can be ordered in 
   $j!$ ways. Each of these orderings is a $j$-permutation of 
   the set of size $n$. The number of $j$-permutations is 
   $(n)_j$, so the number of subsets of size $j$ is $$ 
   \frac{(n)_j}{j!}\ . $$ This completes the proof."
