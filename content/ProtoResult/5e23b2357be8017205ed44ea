. "Suppose that $f$ has $n$ derivatives at $x_0$ and $n$ is 
   the smallest positive integer such that $f^{(n)}(x_0)\ne 0$ 
   (a) If $n$ is odd, $x_0$ is not a local extreme point of $f$
   (b) If $n$ is even, $x_0$ is a local maximum of $f$ if 
   $f^{(n)}(x_0)<0$ or a local mininum of $f$ if 
   $f^{(n)}(x_0)>0$"
