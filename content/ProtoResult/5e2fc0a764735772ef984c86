. "Let $t_i$ be the expected number of steps before the chain 
   is absorbed, given that the chain starts in state $s_i$, and
   let ${ \/}$ be the column vector whose $i$th entry is $t_i$.
   Then $${ \/} = { \/}{ \/}\ $$ where ${ \/}$ is a column 
   vector all of whose entries are 1. .2in {\bf Proof.\ } If we
   add all the entries in the $i$th row of ${ \/}$, we will 
   have the expected number of times in any of the transient 
   states for a given starting state $s_i$, that is, the 
   expected time required before being absorbed. Thus, $t_i$ is
   the sum of the entries in the $i$th row of ${ \/}$. If we 
   write this statement in matrix form, we obtain the theorem."
