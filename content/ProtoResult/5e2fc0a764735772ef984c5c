. "Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent real-valued continuous 
   random variables with finite expected values. Then we have 
   $$ E(XY) = E(X)E(Y)\ . $$ .2in {\bf Proof.\ } We will prove 
   this only in the case that the ranges of $X$ and $Y$ are 
   contained in the intervals $[a, b]$ and $[c, d]$, 
   respectively. Let the density functions of $X$ and $Y$ be 
   denoted by $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$, respectively. Since $X$ 
   and $Y$ are independent, the joint density function of $X$ 
   and $Y$ is the product of the individual density functions. 
   Hence $$ E(XY) & = & \int_a^b \int_c^d xy f_X(x) f_Y(y) dy 
   dx \\ & = & \int_a^b x f_X(x) dx \int_c^d y f_Y(y) dy \\ & =
   & E(X)E(Y)\ . $$ \par The proof in the general case involves
   using sequences of bounded random variables that approach 
   $X$ and $Y$, and is somewhat technical, so we will omit it."
