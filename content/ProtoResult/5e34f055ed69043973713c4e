. "Suppose $p$ and $q$ are continuous on an open interval 
   $(a,b)$ let $y_1$ and $y_2$ be solutions of \begin{equation}
   y''+p(x)y'+q(x)y=0 \end{equation} on $(a,b)$ and let 
   $W=y_1y_2'-y_1'y_2$ Then $y_1$ and $y_2$ are linearly 
   independent on $(a,b)$ if and only if $W$ has no zeros on 
   $(a,b)$"
