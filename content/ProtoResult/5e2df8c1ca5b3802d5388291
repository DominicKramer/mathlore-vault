. "If a permutation $\sigma$ can be expressed as the product 
   of an even number of transpositions, then any other product 
   of transpositions equaling $\sigma$ must also contain an 
   even number of transpositions. Similarly, if $\sigma$ can be
   expressed as the product of an odd number of transpositions,
   then any other product of transpositions equaling $\sigma$ 
   must also contain an odd number of transpositions."
