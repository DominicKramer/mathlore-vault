. "Let $f$ be bounded on $[a,b]$, and let $P$ be a partition 
   of $[a,b]$ Then (a) The upper sum $S(P)$ of $f$ over $P$ is 
   the supremum of the set of all Riemann sums of $f$ over $P$ 
   (b) The lower sum $s(P)$ of $f$ over $P$ is the infimum of 
   the set of all Riemann sums of $f$ over $P$"
