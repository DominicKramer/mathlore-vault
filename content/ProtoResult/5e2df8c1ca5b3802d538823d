. "Let $D$ be an integral domain. Then $D$ can be embedded in 
   a field of fractions $F_D$, where any element in $F_D$ can 
   be expressed as the quotient of two elements in $D$. 
   Furthermore, the field of fractions $F_D$ is unique in the 
   sense that if $E$ is any field containing $D$, then there 
   exists a map $\psi : F_D arrow E$ giving an isomorphism with
   a subfield of $E$ such that $\psi(a) = a$ for all elements 
   $a \in D$."
