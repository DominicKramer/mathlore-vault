ProtoTheorem:
. "Let the $m \times n$ binary matrix $H$ determine a linear 
   code and let ${\mathbf x}$ be the received $n$-tuple. Write 
   ${\mathbf x}$ as ${\mathbf x} = {\mathbf c} +{\mathbf e}$, 
   where ${\mathbf c}$ is the transmitted codeword and 
   ${\mathbf e}$ is the transmission error. Then the syndrome 
   $H{\mathbf x}$ of the received codeword ${\mathbf x}$ is 
   also the syndrome of the error ${\mathbf e}$."
