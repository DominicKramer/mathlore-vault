. "Let $H \in {\mathbb M}_{ m \times n} ( {\mathbb Z}_2)$ and 
   suppose that the linear code corresponding to $H$ is single 
   error-correcting. Let ${\mathbf r}$ be a received $n$-tuple 
   that was transmitted with at most one error. If the syndrome
   of ${\mathbf r}$ is ${\mathbf 0}$, then no error has 
   occurred; otherwise, if the syndrome of ${\mathbf r}$ is 
   equal to some column of $H$, say the $i$th column, then the 
   error has occurred in the $i$th bit."
