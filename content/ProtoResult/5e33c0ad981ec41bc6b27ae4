. "Let $L$ be a nonempty set with two binary operations $\vee$
   and $\wedge$ satisfying the commutative, associative, 
   idempotent, and absorption laws. We can define a partial 
   order on $L$ by $a \preceq b$ if $a \vee b = b$. 
   Furthermore, $L$ is a lattice with respect to $\preceq$ if 
   for all $a, b \in L$, we define the least upper bound and 
   greatest lower bound of $a$ and $b$ by $a \vee b$ and $a 
   \wedge b$, respectively."
