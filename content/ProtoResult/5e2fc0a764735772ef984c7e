. "Let $ { \/}$ be the transition matrix of a Markov chain. 
   The $ij$th entry $p_{ij}^{(n)}$ of the matrix $ { \/}^n$ 
   gives the probability that the Markov chain, starting in 
   state $s_i$, will be in state $s_j$ after $n$ steps. .2in 
   {\bf Proof.\ } The proof of this theorem is left as an 
   exercise Exercise 11.1.18 ."
