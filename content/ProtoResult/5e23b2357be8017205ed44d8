. "Suppose that $f$ is continuous on a finite closed interval 
   $[a,b]$ Let $$ \alpha=\inf_{a\le x\le b}f(x) 
   \beta=\sup_{a\le x\le b}f(x). $$ Then $\alpha$ and $\beta$ 
   are respectively the minimum and maximum of $f$ on $[a,b]$ 
   that is, there are points $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $[a,b]$ such 
   that $$ f(x_1)=\alpha f(x_2)=\beta. $$"
