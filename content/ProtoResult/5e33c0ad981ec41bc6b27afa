. "Let $n$ be an integer such that $n > 1$. Then \[ n = p_1 
   p_2 \cdots p_k, \] where $p_1, \ldots, p_k$ are primes (not 
   necessarily distinct). Furthermore, this factorization is 
   unique; that is, if \[ n = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_l, \] then $k = 
   l$ and the $q_i$'s are just the $p_i$'s rearranged."
