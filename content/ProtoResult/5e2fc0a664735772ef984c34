. "{\bf (Binomial Theorem)} The quantity $(a + b)^n$ can be 
   expressed in the form $$ (a + b)^n = \sum_{j = 0}^n {n 
   \choose j} a^j b^{n - j}\ . $$ .2in {\bf Proof.\ } To see 
   that this expansion is correct, write $$ (a + b)^n = (a + 
   b)(a + b) \cdots (a + b)\ . $$ When we multiply this out we 
   will have a sum of terms each of which results from a choice
   of an $a$ or $b$ for each of $n$ factors. When we choose $j$
   $a$'s and $(n - j)$ $b$'s, we obtain a term of the form $a^j
   b^{n - j}$. To determine such a term, we have to specify $j$
   of the $n$ terms in the product from which we choose the 
   $a$. This can be done in $n \choose j$ ways. Thus, 
   collecting these terms in the sum contributes a term ${n 
   \choose j} a^j b^{n - j}$."
