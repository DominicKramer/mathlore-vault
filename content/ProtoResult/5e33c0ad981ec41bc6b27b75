. "Let $\phi : E \rightarrow F$ be an isomorphism of fields. 
   Let $K$ be an extension field of $E$ and $\alpha \in K$ be 
   algebraic over $E$ with minimal polynomial $p(x)$. Suppose 
   that $L$ is an extension field of $F$ such that $\beta$ is 
   root of the polynomial in $F $ obtained from $p(x)$ under 
   the image of $\phi$. Then $\phi$ extends to a unique 
   isomorphism $\psi : E( \alpha ) \rightarrow F( \beta )$ such
   that $\psi( \alpha ) = \beta$ and $\psi$ agrees with $\phi$ 
   on $E$."
