. "Let $H = (A \mid I_m )$ be an $m \times n$ canonical 
   parity-check matrix and let $G = \left( \frac{I_{n-m} }{A} 
   \right) $ be the $n \times (n-m)$ standard generator matrix 
   associated with $H$. Let $C$ be the code generated by $G$. 
   Then ${\mathbf y}$ is in $C$ if and only if $H {\mathbf y} =
   {\mathbf 0}$. In particular, $C$ is a linear code with 
   canonical parity-check matrix $H$."
