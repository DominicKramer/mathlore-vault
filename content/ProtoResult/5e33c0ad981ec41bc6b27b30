. "bf{(Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory)} Let $F$ be a 
   finite field or a field of characteristic zero. If $E$ is a 
   finite normal extension of $F$ with Galois group $G(E/F)$, 
   then the following statements are true. \begin{enumerate} 
   \item \it The map $K \mapsto G(E/K)$ is a bijection of 
   subfields $K$ of $E$ containing $F$ with the subgroups of 
   $G(E/F)$. \item \it If $F \subset K \subset E$, then \[ 
   [E:K] = |G(E/K)| and [K:F] = [G(E/F):G(E/K)]. \] \item \it 
   $F \subset K \subset L \subset E$ if and only if $\{ id \} 
   \subset G(E/L) \subset G(E/K) \subset G(E/F)$. \item \it $K$
   is a normal extension of $F$ if and only if $G(E/K)$ is a 
   normal subgroup of $G( E/F)$. In this case \[ G(K/F) \cong 
   G(E/F) / G( E/K ). \] \end{enumerate}"
