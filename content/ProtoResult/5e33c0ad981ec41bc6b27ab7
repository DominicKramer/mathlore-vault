. "Let $E$ be an extension field of a field $F$ and $\alpha 
   \in E$ with $\alpha$ algebraic over $F$. Then there is a 
   unique irreducible monic polynomial $p(x) \in F $ of 
   smallest degree such that $p( \alpha ) = 0$. If $f(x)$ is 
   another polynomial in $F $ such that $f(\alpha) = 0$, then 
   $p(x)$ divides $f(x)$."
