. "If $D$ is any ordering that is the result of applying an 
   $a$-shuffle and then a $b$-shuffle to the identity ordering,
   then the probability assigned to $D$ by this pair of 
   operations is the same as the probability assigned to $D$ by
   the process of applying an $ab$-shuffle to the identity 
   ordering. .2in {\bf Proof.\ } Call the sample space of 
   $a$-shuffles $S_a$. If we label the stacks by the integers 
   from $0$ to $a-1$, then each cut-interleaving pair, i.e., 
   shuffle, corresponds to exactly one $n$-digit base $a$ 
   integer, where the $i$th digit in the integer is the stack 
   of which the $i$th card is a member. Thus, the number of 
   cut-interleaving pairs is equal to the number of $n$-digit 
   base $a$ integers, which is $a^n$. Of course, not all of 
   these pairs leads to different orderings. The number of 
   pairs leading to a given ordering will be discussed later. 
   For our purposes it is enough to point out that it is the 
   cut-interleaving pairs that determine the probability 
   assignment. \par The previous theorem shows that there is a 
   1-1 correspondence between $S_{a,b}$ and $S_{ab}$. 
   Furthermore, corresponding elements give the same ordering 
   when applied to the identity ordering. Given any ordering 
   $D$, let $m_1$ be the number of elements of $S_{a,b}$ which,
   when applied to the identity ordering, result in $D$. Let 
   $m_2$ be the number of elements of $S_{ab}$ which, when 
   applied to the identity ordering, result in $D$. The 
   previous theorem implies that $m_1 = m_2$. Thus, both sets 
   assign the probability $${{m_1}\over{(ab)^n}}$$ to $D$. This
   completes the proof."
