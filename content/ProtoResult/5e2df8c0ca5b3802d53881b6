. "Let $\phi : G arrow H$ be an isomorphism of two groups. 
   Then the following statements are true. \begin{enumerate} 
   \item \it $\phi^{-1} : H arrow G$ is an isomorphism. \item 
   \it $|G| = |H|$. \item \it If $G$ is abelian, then $H$ is 
   abelian. \item \it If $G$ is cyclic, then $H$ is cyclic. 
   \item \it If $G$ has a subgroup of order $n$, then $H$ has a
   subgroup of order $n$. \end{enumerate}"
