. "Suppose the coefficient matrix $A$ and the forcing function
   ${\bf f}$ are continuous on $(a,b)$, let $t_0$ be in 
   $(a,b)$, and let ${\bf k}$ be an arbitrary constant 
   $n$-vector. Then the initial value problem $$ {\bf 
   y}'=A(t){\bf y}+{\bf f}(t), \quad {\bf y}(t_0)={\bf k} $$ 
   has a unique solution on $(a,b)$."
