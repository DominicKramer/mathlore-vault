ProtoTheorem:
. "If $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and $a\le c\le b$ then 
   $F(x)=\int_c^x f(t)\,dt$ is differentiable at any point 
   $x_0$ in $(a,b)$ where $f$ is continuous, with 
   $F'(x_0)=f(x_0)$ If $f$ is continuous from the right at $a$ 
   then $F_+'(a)=f(a)$. If $f$ is continuous from the left at 
   $b$ then $F_-'(b)=f(b)$"
