. "Let $\phi : G \rightarrow H$ be an isomorphism of two 
   groups. Then the following statements are true. 
   \begin{enumerate} \item \it $\phi^{-1} : H \rightarrow G$ is
   an isomorphism. \item \it $|G| = |H|$. \item \it If $G$ is 
   abelian, then $H$ is abelian. \item \it If $G$ is cyclic, 
   then $H$ is cyclic. \item \it If $G$ has a subgroup of order
   $n$, then $H$ has a subgroup of order $n$. \end{enumerate}"
