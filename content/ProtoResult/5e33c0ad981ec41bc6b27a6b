. "Let $\phi : G \rightarrow H$ be an isomorphism of two
groups. Then the following statements are true.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\phi^{-1} : H \rightarrow G$ is
        an isomorphism.
  \item $|G| = |H|$.
  \item If $G$ is abelian, then $H$ is abelian.
  \item If $G$ is cyclic, then $H$ is cyclic.
  \item If $G$ has a subgroup of order $n$, then $H$ has a
        subgroup of order $n$.
\end{enumerate}"
