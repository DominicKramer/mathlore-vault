ProtoResult:
. "Consider a branching process with generating function 
   $h(z)$ for the number of offspring of a given parent. Let 
   $d$ be the smallest root of the equation $z = h(z)$. If the 
   mean number $m$ of offspring produced by a single parent is 
   ${} \leq 1$, then $d = 1$ and the process dies out with 
   probability~1. If $m > 1$ then $d < 1$ and the process dies 
   out with probability $d$."
