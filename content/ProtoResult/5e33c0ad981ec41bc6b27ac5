. "Let $C$ be an $(n,k)$-linear code given by the matrix $H$ 
   and suppose that ${\mathbf x}$ and ${\mathbf y}$ are in 
   ${\mathbb Z}_2^n$. Then ${\mathbf x}$ and ${\mathbf y}$ are 
   in the same coset of $C$ if and only if $H{\mathbf x} = 
   H{\mathbf y}$. That is, two $n$-tuples are in the same coset
   if and only if their syndromes are the same."
