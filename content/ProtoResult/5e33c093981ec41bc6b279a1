. "Suppose that for $n$ sufficiently large (that is, for $n 
   \ge some integer N$) the terms of $\sum_{n=k}^\infty a_n$ 
   satisfy some condition that implies convergence of an 
   infinite series. Then $\sum_{n=k}^\infty a_n$ converges. 
   Similarly, suppose that for $n$ sufficiently large the terms
   $\sum_{n=k}^\infty a_n$ satisfy some condition that implies 
   divergence of an infinite series. Then $\sum_{n=k}^\infty 
   a_n$ diverges."
