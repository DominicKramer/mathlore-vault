. "Let ${ \/}$ be the transition matrix for a regular chain. 
   Then, as $n \to \infty$, the powers ${ \/}^n$ approach a 
   limiting matrix ${ \/}$ with all rows the same vector ${ 
   \/}$. The vector ${ \/}$ is a strictly positive probability 
   vector (i.e., the components are all positive and they sum 
   to one)."
