. "Let $J$ be the random variable which, for a given random 
   walk of length $2m$, gives the smallest subscript $j$ such 
   that $S_{j} = S_{2m}$. (Such a subscript $j$ must be even, 
   by parity considerations.) Let $\gamma_{2k, 2m}$ be the 
   probability that $J = 2k$. Then we have $$\gamma_{2k, 2m} = 
   \alpha_{2k, 2m}\ $$"
