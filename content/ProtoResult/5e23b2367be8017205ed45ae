. "Let $\mathbf{A}$ be an $n\times n$ matrix. (a) The sum of 
   the products of the entries of a row of $\mathbf{A}$ and 
   their cofactors equals $\det(\mathbf{A})$ while the sum of 
   the products of the entries of a row of $\mathbf{A}$ and the
   cofactors of the entries of a different row equals zero$$ 
   that is, $ \sum^n_{k=1} a_{ik}c_{jk}= \{

   products of the entries of a column of $\mathbf{A}$ and 
   their cofactors equals $\det(\mathbf{A})$ while the sum of 
   the products of the entries of a column of $\mathbf{A}$ and
