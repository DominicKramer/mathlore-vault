. "Let $\mathbf{F}=(f_1,f_2, $\dots$,f_m):\R^n\to\R^m$ and 
   suppose that the partial derivatives $ \frac{\partial 
   f_i}{\partial x_j}, 1\le i\le m, 1\le j\le n, $ exist on a 
   neighborhood of $\mathbf{X}_0$ and are continuous at 
   $\mathbf{X}_0$ Then $\mathbf{F}$ is differentiable at 
   $\mathbf{X}_0$"
