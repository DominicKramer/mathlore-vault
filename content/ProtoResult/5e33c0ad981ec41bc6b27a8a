. "If $H \in {\mathbb M}_{m \times n}({\mathbb Z}_2)$ is a
canonical parity-check matrix, then $\textrm{Null}(H)$ consists of
all ${\mathbf x} \in {\mathbb Z}_2^n$ whose first $n-m$ bits
are arbitrary but whose last $m$ bits are determined by
$H{\mathbf x} = {\mathbf 0}$. Each of the last $m$ bits
serves as an even parity check bit for some of the first
$n-m$ bits. Hence, $H$ gives rise to an $(n, n-m)$-block
code."
