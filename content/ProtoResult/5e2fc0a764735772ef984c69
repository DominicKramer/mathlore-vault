. "Let $a$ and $n$ be positive integers. Then $ a^n = \sum_{r 
   = 1}^a {{n + a - r}\choose{n}}A(n, r)\ . $ Thus, $$ A(n, a) 
   = a^n - \sum_{r = 1}^{a-1}{{n + a - r}\choose{n}}A(n, r)\ . 
   $$ In addition, $$A(n, 1) = 1\ $$ .2in {\bf Proof.\ } The 
   second equation can be used to calculate the values of the 
   Eulerian numbers, and follows immediately from the Equation 
   3.6}. The last equation is a consequence of the fact that 
   the only ordering of $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ with one rising 
   sequence is the identity ordering. Thus, it remains to prove
   Equation~\ref{eq 3.6}. We will count the set of $a$-shuffles
   of a deck with $n$ cards in two ways. First, we know that 
   there are $a^n$ such shuffles (this was noted in the proof 
   of Theorem~\ref{thm 3.3.2}). But there are $A(n, r)$ 
   orderings of $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ with $r$ rising 
   sequences, and Theorem~\ref{thm 3.3.3} states that for each 
   such ordering, there are exactly $${{n+a-r}\choose n}$$ 
   cut-interleaving pairs that lead to the ordering. Therefore,
   the right-hand side of Equation~\ref{eq 3.6 counts the set 
   of $a$-shuffles of an $n$-card deck. This completes 
   the\linebreak proof."
