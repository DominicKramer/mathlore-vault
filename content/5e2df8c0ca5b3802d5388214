. "Let $\phi : E arrow F$ be an isomorphism of fields and let 
   $p(x)$ be a nonconstant polynomial in $E $ and $q(x)$ the 
   corresponding polynomial in $F $ under the isomorphism. If 
   $K$ is a splitting field of $p(x)$ and $L$ is a splitting 
   field of $q(x)$, then $\phi$ extends to an isomorphism $\psi
   : K arrow L$."
