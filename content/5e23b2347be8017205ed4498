ProtoDefines:
. "A subset $S$ of $\R^n$ is connected if it is impossible to 
   represent $S$ as the union of two disjoint nonempty sets 
   such that neither contains a limit point of the other; that 
   is, if $S$ cannot be expressed as $S=A\cup B$, where $ 
   A\ne\emptyset, B\ne\emptyset, \overline{A}\cap B= \emptyset,
   A\cap\overline{B}=\emptyset. $ If $S$ can be expressed in 
   this way, then $S$ is disconnected."
