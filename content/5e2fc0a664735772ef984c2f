. "Given $n$ Bernoulli trials with probability $p$ of success 
   on each experiment, the probability of exactly $j$ successes
   is $$ b(n,p,j) = {n \choose j} p^j q^{n - j} $$ where $q = 1
   - p$. .2in {\bf Proof.\ } We construct a tree measure as 
   described above. We want to find the sum of the 
   probabilities for all paths which have exactly $j$ successes
   and $n - j$ failures. Each such path is assigned a 
   probability $p^j q^{n - j}$. How many such paths are there? 
   To specify a path, we have to pick, from the $n$ possible 
   trials, a subset of $j$ to be successes, with the remaining 
   $n-j$ outcomes being failures. We can do this in $n \choose 
   j$ ways. Thus the sum of the probabilities is $$ b(n,p,j) = 
   {n \choose j} p^j q^{n - j}\ . $$"
