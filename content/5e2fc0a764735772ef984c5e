. "If an ordering of length $n$ has $r$ rising sequences, then
   the number of cut-interleaving pairs under an $a$-shuffle of
   the identity ordering which lead to the ordering is $${{n + 
   a - r}\choose{n}}\ $$ .2in {\bf Proof.\ } To see why this is
   true, we need to count the number of ways in which the cut 
   in an $a$-shuffle can be performed which will lead to a 
   given ordering with $r$ rising sequences. We can disregard 
   the interleavings, since once a cut has been made, at most 
   one interleaving will lead to a given ordering. Since the 
   given ordering has $r$ rising sequences, $r-1$ of the 
   division points in the cut are determined. The remaining $a 
   - 1 - (r - 1) = a - r$ division points can be placed 
   anywhere. The number of places to put these remaining 
   division points is $n+1$ (which is the number of spaces 
   between the consecutive pairs of cards, including the 
   positions at the beginning and the end of the deck). These 
   places are chosen with repetition allowed, so the number of 
   ways to make these choices is $${{n + a - r}\choose{a-r}} = 
   {{n + a - r}\choose{n}}\ $$ \par In particular, this means 
   that if $D$ is an ordering that is the result of applying an
   $a$-shuffle to the identity ordering, and if $D$ has $r$ 
   rising sequences, then the probability assigned to $D$ by 
   this process is $${{{{n + a - r}\choose{n}}}\over{a^n}}\ $$ 
   This completes the proof."
