. "Let $\phi : E arrow F$ be an isomorphism of fields. Let $K$
   be an extension field of $E$ and $\alpha \in K$ be algebraic
   over $E$ with minimal polynomial $p(x)$. Suppose that $L$ is
   an extension field of $F$ such that $\beta$ is root of the 
   polynomial in $F $ obtained from $p(x)$ under the image of 
   $\phi$. Then $\phi$ extends to a unique isomorphism $\psi : 
   E( \alpha ) arrow F( \beta )$ such that $\psi( \alpha ) = 
   \beta$ and $\psi$ agrees with $\phi$ on $E$."
