. "If $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\Omega$, then $ P(A \cup B) 
   = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)\ . $ .2in {\bf Proof.\ } The 
   left side of Equation 1.1} is the sum of $m(\omega)$ for 
   $\omega$ in either $A$ or $B$. We must show that the right 
   side of Equation~\ref{eq 1.1} also adds $m(\omega)$ for 
   $\omega$ in $A$ or $B$. If $\omega$ is in exactly one of the
   two sets, then it is counted in only one of the three terms 
   on the right side of Equation~\ref{eq 1.1}. If it is in both
   $A$ and $B$, it is added twice from the calculations of 
   $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ and subtracted once for $P(A \cap B)$. 
   Thus it is counted exactly once by the right side. Of 
   course, if $A \cap B = \emptyset$, then Equation~\ref{eq 
   1.1} reduces to Property~4. (Equation~\ref{eq 1.1} can also 
   be generalized; see Theorem~\ref{thm 3.10 .)"
