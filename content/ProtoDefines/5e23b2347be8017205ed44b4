. "Let $S$ be a subset of $A$. Then (a) $u_0$ is a limit point
   of $S$ if every deleted neighborhood of $u_0$ contains a 
   point of~$S$. (b) $u_0$ is a boundary point of $S$ if every 
   neighborhood of $u_0$ contains at least one point in $S$ and
   one not in $S$. The set of boundary points of $S$ is the 
   boundary of $S$, denoted by $\partial S$. The closure of 
   $S$, denoted by $\overline{S}$, is defined by 
   $\overline{S}=S\cup \partial S$. (c) $u_0$ is an isolated 
   point of $S$ if $u_0\in S$ and there is a neighborhood of 
   $u_0$ that contains no other point of $S$. (d) $u_0$ is 
   exterior } to $S$ if $u_0$ is in the interior of $S^c$. The 
   collection of such points is the {\it exterior of $S$."
