. "A \term{group} is a set $G$ equipped with a binary operation
   $G \times G \to G$ (denoted by multiplication below) and an 
   identity element $1\in G$ such that: \begin{enumerate} \item
   For all $a,b,c\in G$, we have $(ab)c = a(bc)$. \item For 
   each $a\in G$, we have $1a=a1=a$, and there exists $b\in G$ 
   such that $ab = 1$. \end{enumerate}"
