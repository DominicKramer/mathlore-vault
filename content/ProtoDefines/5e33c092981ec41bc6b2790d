. "A function $f$ is \term{ continuous on an open interval }
$(a,b)$ if it is continuous at every point in $(a,b)$. If,
in addition,
\[
    f(b-)=f(b)
\]
or
\[
    f(a+)=f(a)
\]
then $f$ is \term{ continuous on $(a,b]$ or
$[a,b)$ }, respectively. If $f$ is continuous on $(a,b)$ and
and both hold, then \term{ $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ }.
More generally, if $S$ is a subset of $D_f$ consisting of
finitely or infinitely many disjoint intervals, then $f$ is
\term{ continuous on $S$ } if $f$ is continuous on every
interval in $S$. (Henceforth, in connection with functions
of one variable, whenever we say ''$f$ is continuous on
$S$'' we mean that $S$ is a set of this kind.)"
