. "A function $f$ is \term{ continuous on an open interval } 
   $(a,b)$ if it is continuous at every point in $(a,b)$. If, 
   in addition, \begin{eqnarray} f(b-)=f(b) \\ or \\ f(a+)=f(a)
   \end{eqnarray} then $f$ is \term{ continuous on $(a,b]$ or 
   $[a,b)$ }, respectively. If $f$ is continuous on $(a,b)$ and
   and both hold, then \term{ $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ }. 
   More generally, if $S$ is a subset of $D_f$ consisting of 
   finitely or infinitely many disjoint intervals, then $f$ is 
   \term{ continuous on $S$ } if $f$ is continuous on every 
   interval in $S$. (Henceforth, in connection with functions 
   of one variable, whenever we say ``$f$ is continuous on 
   $S$'' we mean that $S$ is a set of this kind.)"
