ProtoDefines:
. "A transformation $\mathbf{F}: \R^n\to \R^n$ is regular on 
   an open set $S$ if $\mathbf{F}$ is one-to-one and 
   continuously differentiable on $S$, and 
   $J\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{X})\ne0$ if $\mathbf{X}\in S$. We will 
   also say that $\mathbf{F}$ is regular on an arbitrary set 
   $S$ if $\mathbf{F}$ is regular on an open set containing 
   $S$."
