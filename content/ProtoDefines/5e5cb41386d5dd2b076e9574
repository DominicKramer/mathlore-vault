. "We call a nonzero rational number $n$ a \term{ congruent
number} if $\pm n$ is the area of a right triangle with
rational side lengths. Equivalently, $n$ is a \term{ congruent
number} if the system of two equations
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    a^2+b^2&=&c^2 \\
    \frac{1}{2}ab &=&n
  \end{aligned}
\]
has a solution with $a,b,c\in\mathbf{Q}$."
