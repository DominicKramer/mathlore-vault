. "If every curve in a one-parameter family defined by the 
   equation \begin{equation} H(x,y,c)=0 \end{equation} is an 
   integral curve of the first order differential equation 
   \begin{equation} F(x,y,y')=0, \end{equation} then is said to
   be a \term{ differential equation for the family. }"
