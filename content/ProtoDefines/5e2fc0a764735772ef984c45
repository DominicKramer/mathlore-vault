. "Let $X$ be a numerically-valued discrete random variable 
   with sample space $\Omega$ and distribution function $m(x)$.
   The expected value $E(X)$ is defined by $$ E(X) = \sum_{x 
   \in \Omega} x m(x)\ , $$ provided this sum converges 
   absolutely. We often refer to the expected value as the 
   {mean,\/} and denote $E(X)$ by $\mu$ for short. If the above
   sum does not converge absolutely, then we say that $X$ does 
   not have an expected value."
