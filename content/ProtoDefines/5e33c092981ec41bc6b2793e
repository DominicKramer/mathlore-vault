. "A sequence $\{s_n\}$ is {\it bounded above } if there is a 
   real number $b$ such that $$ s_n\le b \quad for all $n$ , $$
   {\it bounded below } if there is a real number $a$ such that
   $$ s_n\ge a \quad for all $n$ , $$ or {\it bounded } if 
   there is a real number $r$ such that $$ |s_n|\le r \quad for
   all $n$ . $$"
