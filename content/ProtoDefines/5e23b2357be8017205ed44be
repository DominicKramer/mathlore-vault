. "We say that $f$ is continuous at $\widehat u$ if $\widehat 
   u\in D_f$ and for each $\epsilon>0$ there is a $\delta>0$ 
   such that $ \sigma(f(u),f(\widehat u))<\epsilon u\in D_f\cap
   N_\delta(\widehat u). $ If $f$ is continuous at every point 
   of a set $S$, then $f$ is continuous on S."
