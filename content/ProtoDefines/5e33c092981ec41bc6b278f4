. "Let $S$ be a subset of ${\mathcal R}$. Then \begin{alist} 
   \item $x_0$ is a \term{ limit point } of $S$ if every deleted 
   neighborhood of $x_0$ contains a point of $S$. \item $x_0$ 
   is a \term{ boundary point } of $S$ if every neighborhood of 
   $x_0$ contains at least one point in $S$ and one not in $S$.
   The set of boundary points of $S$ is the \term{ boundary } of 
   $S$, denoted by $ ial S$. The \term{ closure } of $S$, denoted
   by $\overline{S}$, is $\overline{S}=S\cup ial S$. \item 
   $x_0$ is an \emph{isolated point} of $S$ if $x_0\in S$ and 
   there is a neighborhood of $x_0$ that contains no other 
   point of $S$. \item $x_0$ is \emph{exterior} to $S$ if $x_0$
   is in the interior of $S^c$. The collection of such points 
   is the \term{ exterior } of $S$. \end{alist}"
