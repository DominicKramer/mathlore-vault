ProtoDefines:
. "A {Bernoulli trials process\/} is a sequence of $n$ chance 
   experiments such that \begin{enumerate} \item Each 
   experiment has two possible outcomes, which we may call 
   {success\/} and {failure.\/} \item The probability $p$ of 
   success on each experiment is the same for each experiment, 
   and this probability is not affected by any knowledge of 
   previous outcomes. The probability $q$ of failure is given 
   by $q = 1 - p$. \end{enumerate}"
