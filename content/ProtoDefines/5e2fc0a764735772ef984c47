. "If $F$ is any event and $X$ is a random variable with 
   sample space $\Omega = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots\}$, then the 
   {conditional expectation given $F$\/} is defined by $$ 
   E(X|F) = \sum_j x_j P(X = x_j|F)\ . $$ Conditional 
   expectation is used most often in the form provided by the 
   following theorem."
