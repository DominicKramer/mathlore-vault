. "Let $G$ and $H$ be groups. A map $\varphi:G \to H$ is a 
   {\em group homomorphism} if for all $a,b\in G$ we have 
   $\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a) \varphi(b)$. A group homomorphism 
   is called {\em surjective} if for every $c\in H$ there is 
   $a\in G$ such that $\varphi(a) = c$. The {\em kernel} of a 
   group homomorphism $\varphi:G\to H$ is the set 
   $\ker(\varphi)$ of elements $a\in G$ such that $\varphi(a) =
   1$. A group homomorphism is {\em injective} if 
   $\ker(\varphi) = \{1\}$."
