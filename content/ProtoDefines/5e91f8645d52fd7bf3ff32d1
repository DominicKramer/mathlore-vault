ProtoDefines:
. "A \term{ring} is a set $R$ equipped with two operations $+$ and $\cdot$ (typically referred to as \it{addition} and \it{multiplication,} respectively) such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(R, +)$ is an \term{abelian group;}
\item multiplication is associative;
\item multiplication is left- and right-distributive over addition.
\end{enumerate}
Note that multiplication is often denoted by juxtaposition; i.e. $a \cdot b$ is equivalent to $ab$. Now, we can further classify rings based on additional properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $0 \in R$ denote the additive identity element. Suppose there exists some $1$ in $R$ such that, for all elements $r$ of $R$, $r \cdot 1 = r = 1 \cdot r.$ Then, $R$ is a \term{ring with unit.} In general, this property is assumed.
\item If, for all elements $a$ and $b$ in $R$, $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$, then $R$ is a \term{commutative ring.}
\end{itemize}"
