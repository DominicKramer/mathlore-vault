. "Let $n$ be a positive integer, and let $p$ be a real number
   between 0 and 1. Let $B$ be the random variable which counts
   the number of successes in a Bernoulli trials process with 
   parameters $n$ and $p$. Then the distribution $b(n, p, k)$ 
   of $B$ is called the {binomial distribution\/}."
