ProtoDefines:
. "(a) We say that $f$ is differentiable on the closed 
   interval $[a,b]$ if $f$ is differentiable on the open 
   interval $(a,b)$ and $f_+'(a)$ and $f_-'(b)$ both exist. (b)
   We say that $f$ is continuously differentiable on $[a,b]$ if
   $f$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$, $f'$ is continuous on 
   $(a,b)$, $f_+'(a)=f'(a+)$, and $f_-'(b)=f'(b-)$."
