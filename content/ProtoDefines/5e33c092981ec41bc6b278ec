. "Let $S$ and $T$ be sets. \begin{alist} \item $S$ \term{ 
   contains } $T$, and we write $S\supset T$ or $T\subset S$, 
   if every member of $T$ is also in $S$. In this case, $T$ is 
   a \term{ subset } of $S$. \item $S-T$ is the set of elements 
   that are in $S$ but not in $T$. \item $S$ \term{ equals } $T$,
   and we write $S=T$, if $S$ contains $T$ and $T$ contains 
   $S$; thus, $S=T$ if and only if $S$ and $T$ have the same 
   members. \item $S$ \term{ strictly contains } $T$ if $S$ 
   contains $T$ but $T$ does not contain $S$; that is, if every
   member of $T$ is also in $S$, but at least one member of $S$
   is not in $T$ . \item The \term{ complement } of $S$, denoted 
   by $S^c$, is the set of elements in the universal set that 
   are not in $S$. \item The \term{ union } of $S$ and $T$, 
   denoted by $S\cup T$, is the set of elements in at least one
   of $S$ and $T$ b ). \item The \term{ intersection } of $S$ and
   $T$, denoted by $S\,\cap\, T$, is the set of elements in 
   both $S$ and $T$ c ). If $S\cap T=\emptyset$ (the empty 
   set), then $S$ and $T$ are \term{ disjoint sets } d ). \item A
   set with only one member $x_0$ is a \term{ singleton set }, 
   denoted by $\{x_0\}$. \end{alist}"
