. "A function $f$ is continuous on an open interval $(a,b)$ if
   it is continuous at every point in $(a,b)$. If, in addition,
   $$ f(b-)=f(b)\\ or \\ f(a+)=f(a) $$ then $f$ is continuous 
   on $(a,b]$ or $[a,b)$, respectively. If $f$ is continuous on
   $(a,b)$ and and both hold, then $f$ is continuous on 
   $[a,b]$. More generally, if $S$ is a subset of $D_f$ 
   consisting of finitely or infinitely many disjoint 
   intervals, then $f$ is continuous on $S$ if $f$ is 
   continuous on every interval in $S$. (Henceforth, in 
   connection with functions of one variable, whenever we say 
   ``$f$ is continuous on $S$'' we mean that $S$ is a set of 
   this kind.)"
