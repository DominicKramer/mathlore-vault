. "Let $S$ and $T$ be sets. (a) $S$ contains $T$, and we write
   $S\supset T$ or $T\subset S$, if every member of $T$ is also
   in $S$. In this case, $T$ is a subset of $S$. (b) $S-T$ is 
   the set of elements that are in $S$ but not in $T$. (c) $S$ 
   equals $T$, and we write $S=T$, if $S$ contains $T$ and $T$ 
   contains $S$; thus, $S=T$ if and only if $S$ and $T$ have 
   the same members. (d) $S$ strictly contains $T$ if $S$ 
   contains $T$ but $T$ does not contain $S$; that is, if every
   member of $T$ is also in $S$, but at least one member of $S$
   is not in $T$ . (e) The complement of $S$, denoted by $S^c$,
   is the set of elements in the universal set that are not in 
   $S$. (f) The union of $S$ and $T$, denoted by $S\cup T$, is 
   the set of elements in at least one of $S$ and $T$ . (g) The
   intersection of $S$ and $T$, denoted by $S \cap T$, is the 
   set of elements in both $S$ and $T$ . If $S\cap T=\emptyset$
   (the empty set), then $S$ and $T$ are disjoint sets . (h) A 
   set with only one member $x_0$ is a singleton set, denoted 
   by $\{x_0\}$."
