. "If $x_0$ is a real number and $\epsilon>0$, then the open 
   interval $(x_0-\epsilon, x_0+\epsilon)$ is an \term{ 
   $\epsilon$-neighborhood } of $x_0$. If a set $S$ contains an
   $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $x_0$, then $S$ is a \term{ 
   neighborhood } of $x_0$, and $x_0$ is an \term{ interior point
   } of $S$ . The set of interior points of $S$ is the \term{ 
   interior } of $S$, denoted by $S^0$. If every point of $S$ 
   is an interior point (that is, $S^0=S$), then $S$ is \term{ 
   open }. A set $S$ is \emph{closed} if $S^c$ is open."
