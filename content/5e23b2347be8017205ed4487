. "A sequence $\{s_n\}$ is nondecreasing if $s_n\ge s_{n-1}$ 
   for all $n$, or nonincreasing if $s_n\le s_{n-1}$ for all 
   $n$ A monotonic sequence is a sequence that is either 
   nonincreasing or nondecreasing. If $s_n>s_{n-1}$ for all 
   $n$, then $\{s_n\}$ is increasing, while if $s_n<s_{n-1}$ 
   for all $n$, $\{s_n\}$ is decreasing."
