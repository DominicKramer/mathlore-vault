. "Let $F$ be a field and suppose that $d(x)$ is the greatest 
   common divisor of two polynomials $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ in $F $.
   Then there exist polynomials $r(x)$ and $s(x)$ such that \[ 
   d(x) = r(x) p(x) + s(x) q(x). \] Furthermore, the greatest 
   common divisor of two polynomials is unique."
