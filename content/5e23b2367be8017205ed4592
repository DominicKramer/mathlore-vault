. "A nonsingular $n\times n$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ can be 
   written as $ 
   \mathbf{A}=\mathbf{E}_k\mathbf{E}_{k-1}\cdots\mathbf{E}_1, $
   where each $\mathbf{E}_i$ is a matrix that can be obtained 
   from the $n\times n$ identity matrix $\mathbf{I}$ by one of 
   the following operations$:$ (a) interchanging two rows of 
   $\mathbf{I}$ (b) multiplying a row of $\mathbf{I}$ by a 
   nonzero constant$$ (c) adding a multiple of one row of 
   $\mathbf{I}$ to another."
