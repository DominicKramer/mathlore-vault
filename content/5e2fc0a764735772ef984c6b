. "The probabilities assigned to events by a distribution 
   function on a sample space $\Omega$ satisfy the following 
   properties: \begin{enumerate} \item $P(E) \geq 0$ for every 
   $E \subset \Omega\ $. \item $P(\Omega) = 1\ $. \item If $E 
   \subset F \subset \Omega$, then $P(E) \leq P(F)\ $. \item If
   $A$ and $B$ are {disjoint\/} subsets of $\Omega$, then $P(A 
   \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\ $. \item $P(\tilde A) = 1 - P(A)$ for
   every $A \subset \Omega\ $. \end{enumerate} .2in {\bf 
   Proof.\ } For any event $E$ the probability $P(E)$ is 
   determined from the distribution $m$ by $$ P(E) = 
   \sum_{\omega \in E} m(\omega)\ , $$ for every $E \subset 
   \Omega$. Since the function $m$ is nonnegative, it follows 
   that $P(E)$ is also nonnegative. Thus, Property 1 is true. 
   \par Property 2 is proved by the equations $$ P(\Omega) = 
   \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} m(\omega) = 1\ . $$ \par Suppose 
   that $E \subset F \subset \Omega$. Then every element 
   $\omega$ that belongs to $E$ also belongs to $F$. Therefore,
   $$ \sum_{\omega \in E} m(\omega) \leq \sum_{\omega \in F} 
   m(\omega)\ , $$ since each term in the left-hand sum is in 
   the right-hand sum, and all the terms in both sums are 
   non-negative. This implies that $$P(E) \le P(F)\ $$ and 
   Property 3 is proved. \par Suppose next that $A$ and $B$ are
   disjoint subsets of $\Omega$. Then every element $\omega$ of
   $A \cup B$ lies either in $A$ and not in $B$ or in $B$ and 
   not in $A$. It follows that $$ P(A \cup B) &= \sum_{\omega 
   \in A \cup B} m(\omega) = \sum_{\omega \in A} m(\omega) + 
   \sum_{\omega \in B} m(\omega) \\ & \\ &= P(A) + P(B)\ , $$ 
   and Property 4 is proved. \par Finally, to prove Property 5,
   consider the disjoint union $$ \Omega = A \cup \tilde A\ . 
   $$ Since $P(\Omega) = 1$, the property of disjoint 
   additivity (Property 4) implies that $$ 1 = P(A) + P(\tilde 
   A)\ , $$ whence $P(\tilde A) = 1 - P(A)$."
