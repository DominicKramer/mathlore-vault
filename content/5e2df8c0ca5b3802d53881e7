. "If $H \in {\mathbb M}_{m \times n}({\mathbb Z}_2)$ is a 
   canonical parity-check matrix, then ${ Null}(H)$ consists of
   all ${\mathbf x} \in {\mathbb Z}_2^n$ whose first $n-m$ bits
   are arbitrary but whose last $m$ bits are determined by 
   $H{\mathbf x} = {\mathbf 0}$. Each of the last $m$ bits 
   serves as an even parity check bit for some of the first 
   $n-m$ bits. Hence, $H$ gives rise to an $(n, n-m)$-block 
   code."
