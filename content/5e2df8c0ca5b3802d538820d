. "Let $F$ be a subfield of ${\mathbb R}$. \begin{enumerate} 
   \item \it If a line contains two points in $F$, then it has 
   the equation $a x + by + c = 0$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are
   in $F$. \item \it If a circle has a center at a point with 
   coordinates in $F$ and a radius that is also in $F$, then it
   has the equation $x^2 + y^2 + d x + e y + f = 0$, where $d$,
   $e$, and $f$ are in $F$. \end{enumerate}"
