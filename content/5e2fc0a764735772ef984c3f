. "Let $a$ and $b$ be two positive integers. Let $S_{a,b}$ be 
   the set of all ordered pairs in which the first entry is an 
   $a$-shuffle and the second entry is a $b$-shuffle. Let 
   $S_{ab}$ be the set of all $ab$-shuffles. Then there is a 
   1-1 correspondence between $S_{a,b}$ and $S_{ab}$ with the 
   following property. Suppose that $(T_1, T_2)$ corresponds to
   $T_3$. If $T_1$ is applied to the identity ordering, and 
   $T_2$ is applied to the resulting ordering, then the final 
   ordering is the same as the ordering that is obtained by 
   applying $T_3$ to the identity ordering. .2in {\bf Proof.\ }
   The easiest way to describe the required correspondence is 
   through the idea of an unshuffle. An $a$-unshuffle begins 
   with a deck of $n$ cards. One by one, cards are taken from 
   the top of the deck and placed, with equal probability, on 
   the bottom of any one of $a$ stacks, where the stacks are 
   labelled from 0 to $a-1$. After all of the cards have been 
   distributed, we combine the stacks to form one stack by 
   placing stack $i$ on top of stack $i+1$, for $0 \le i \le 
   a-1$. It is easy to see that if one starts with a deck, 
   there is exactly one way to cut the deck to obtain the $a$ 
   stacks generated by the $a$-unshuffle, and with these $a$ 
   stacks, there is exactly one way to interleave them to 
   obtain the deck in the order that it was in before the 
   unshuffle was performed. Thus, this $a$-unshuffle 
   corresponds to a unique $a$-shuffle, and this $a$-shuffle is
   the inverse of the original $a$-unshuffle. \par If we apply 
   an $ab$-unshuffle $U_3$ to a deck, we obtain a set of $ab$ 
   stacks, which are then combined, in order, to form one 
   stack. We label these stacks with ordered pairs of integers,
   where the first coordinate is between 0 and $a-1$, and the 
   second coordinate is between 0 and $b-1$. Then we label each
   card with the label of its stack. The number of possible 
   labels is $ab$, as required. Using this labelling, we can 
   describe how to find a $b$-unshuffle and an $a$-unshuffle, 
   such that if these two unshuffles are applied in this order 
   to the deck, we obtain the same set of $ab$ stacks as were 
   obtained by the $ab$-unshuffle. \par To obtain the 
   $b$-unshuffle $U_2$, we sort the deck into $b$ stacks, with 
   the $i$th stack containing all of the cards with second 
   coordinate $i$, for $0 \le i \le b-1$. Then these stacks are
   combined to form one stack. The $a$-unshuffle $U_1$ proceeds
   in the same manner, except that the first coordinates of the
   labels are used. The resulting $a$ stacks are then combined 
   to form one stack. \par The above description shows that the
   cards ending up on top are all those labelled $(0, 0)$. 
   These are followed by those labelled $(0, 1),\ (0, 2)$ $\ 
   \ldots,\ (0, b - 1),\ (1, 0),\ (1,1),\ldots,\ (a-1, b-1)$. 
   Furthermore, the relative order of any pair of cards with 
   the same labels is never altered. But this is exactly the 
   same as an $ab$-unshuffle, if, at the beginning of such an 
   unshuffle, we label each of the cards with one of the labels
   $(0, 0),\ (0, 1),\ \ldots,\ (0, b-1),\ (1, 0),\ (1,1),\ 
   \ldots,\ (a-1, b-1)$. This completes the proof."
