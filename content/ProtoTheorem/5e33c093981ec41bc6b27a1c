ProtoTheorem:
. "In connection with the power series $ $ define $R$ in the 
   extended reals by \begin{equation} \frac{1}{ 
   R}=\limsup_{n\to\infty} |a_n|^{1/n}. \end{equation} In 
   particular, $R=0$ if $\limsup_{n\to\infty} |a_n|^{1/n}= 
   \infty$, and $R=\infty$ if $\limsup_{n\to\infty} 
   |a_n|^{1/n}=0$ Then the power series converges \begin{alist}
   \item only for $x=x_0$ if $R=0$ \item for all $x$ if 
   $R=\infty$ and absolutely uniformly in every bounded set$$ 
   \item for $x$ in $(x_0-R, x_0+R)$ if $0<R<\infty$ and 
   absolutely uniformly in every closed subset of this 
   interval. \end{alist} The series diverges if $|x-x_0|>R$ No 
   general statement can be made concerning convergence at the 
   endpoints $x=x_0+R$ and $x=x_0-R:$ the series may converge 
   absolutely or conditionally at both, converge conditionally 
   at one and diverge at the other, or diverge at both."
