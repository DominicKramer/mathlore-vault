ProtoTheorem:
. "Suppose that $\mathbf{G}: \mathbb{E}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n$ is continuously
differentiable on a bounded open set $N$ containing the
compact Jordan measurable set $S$ and regular on $S^0$
Suppose also that $\mathbf{G}(S)$ is Jordan measurable, $f$
is continuous on $\mathbf{G}(S)$ and $G(C)$ is Jordan
measurable for every cube $C\subset N$. Then
\begin{equation} \int_{\mathbf{G}(S)}
f(\mathbf{X})\,d\mathbf{X}= \int_S f(\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{Y}))
|J\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{Y})|\,d\mathbf{Y}. \end{equation}"
