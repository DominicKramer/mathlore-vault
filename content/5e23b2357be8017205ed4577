. "Suppose that for $n$ sufficiently large (that is, for $n 
   \ge N$) the terms of $\sum_{n=k}^\infty a_n$ satisfy some 
   condition that implies convergence of an infinite series. 
   Then $\sum_{n=k}^\infty a_n$ converges. Similarly, suppose 
   that for $n$ sufficiently large the terms $\sum_{n=k}^\infty
   a_n$ satisfy some condition that implies divergence of an 
   infinite series. Then $\sum_{n=k}^\infty a_n$ diverges."
