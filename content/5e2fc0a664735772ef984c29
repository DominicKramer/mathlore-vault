. "For integers $n$ and $j$, with $0 < j < n$, the binomial 
   coefficients satisfy: $ {n \choose j} = {{n-1} \choose j} + 
   {{n-1} \choose {j - 1}}\ . $ .2in {\bf Proof.\ } We wish to 
   choose a subset of $j$ elements. Choose an element $u$ of 
   $U$. Assume first that we do not want $u$ in the subset. 
   Then we must choose the $j$ elements from a set of $n - 1$ 
   elements; this can be done in ${{n-1} \choose j}$ ways. On 
   the other hand, assume that we do want $u$ in the subset. 
   Then we must choose the other $j - 1$ elements from the 
   remaining $n - 1$ elements of $U$; this can be done in 
   ${{n-1} \choose {j - 1}}$ ways. Since $u$ is either in our 
   subset or not, the number of ways that we can choose a 
   subset of $j$ elements is the sum of the number of subsets 
   of $j$ elements which have $u$ as a member and the number 
   which do not--this is what Equation 3.3 states."
